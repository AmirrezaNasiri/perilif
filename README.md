# Perilif: Period Pain Reliever 🌸

Welcome to Perilif! This is a delightful, heat pad-based buddy designed to soothe menstrual cramps and IBS pain. Built with love on Arduino, it's paired with a cute Android app for easy control.

**Now, a little secret 🤫:** Perilif isn't meant for big-scale, real-life production. Think of it more like a DIY bestie for those curious minds out there. Sure, there are many high-tech gadgets you can buy, but if you fancy crafting something unique for yourself or a loved one, this is a fabulous place to start. 

## Tech Stack 🛠️
Dive into the tech stack behind Perilif:

- **Arduino** 🤖:
  Using the nimble Arduino Nano, it’s the brain of our little device. It chirps via Bluetooth, keeps an eye on things, and makes sure the heat pads are just the right kind of cozy.

- **Kotlin** 📱:
  We've whipped up a nifty Android app using Kotlin. Connect and control your Perilif right from your phone, all thanks to the Bluetooth protocol.

- **Fritzing** 🔧:
  All those wires and thingamajigs? We've sketched them out using Fritzing. It's like a digital canvas, simple and fun to play around with.

Thanks for stopping by! Happy crafting and stay comfy! 😊❤️
